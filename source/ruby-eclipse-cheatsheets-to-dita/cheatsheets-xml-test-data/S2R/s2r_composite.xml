      <intro>
         Before running through this cheat-sheet, you should really have 
         completed the <b>A Debrief walkthrough</b>  cheat-sheet, so you 
         know how to configure Debrief and how to load your data.  
         If you haven&apos;t completed the Debrief walkthrough, 
         click on <b>Restore Welcome</b> at the top of this window (or select <b>Welcome</b> from the Help menu), 
         navigate to the Tutorials tab, and start the Debrief walkthrough.

      <task kind="cheatsheet" name="Tidying the ownship track" skip="false">
         <intro>
            <b>Frequently, before you can start work on producing the red track, you must perform some grooming of the ownship track.</b>
         </intro>
         <onCompletion>
            In that task, you fixed some jumps in the ownship track, and filled in a period of missing data. You won&apos;t need the current plot for the next stage of the tutorial, so you can close it (by clicking in the &apos;x&apos; in its title tab) - and no, you won&apos;t need to save changes.

         <intro>
            Now it&apos;s time to start building the target track
         </intro>
         <onCompletion>
            You&apos;ve now learnt how to create and manage target tracks in Debrief.

            <intro>
               Now we&apos;ve learned about how to groom data by drag and dropping segments we&apos;re going to encounter the <b>Grid Editor</b>  - a Debrief panel dedicated to editing raw data.
            </intro>
            <onCompletion>
               We&apos;ve now got a track with lovely smooth sensor data. Hmm.

            <intro>
               The next step of the analysis process is to produce a valid target track from our tidied data
            </intro>
            <onCompletion>
               We now have a pair of target track sections.

            <intro>
               Next we&apos;re going to combine the discrete track segments into a tidy target track ready for subsequent analysis.
            </intro>
            <onCompletion>
               That&apos;s all the skills you need for single sided reconstruction using Debrief.  Clearly there&apos;s probably now another step to be performed in how you exploit your shiny new track, but that would depend on your analysis objective.
