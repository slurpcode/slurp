         This series of cheatsheets will guide you through creating your Debrief working environment, customising it according to your preferred file locations, and loading some analysis data.  If you wish, you can widen this &apos;Welcome&apos; panel to make the tutorials easier to read.  You may also find it easier to work through these cheat-sheets if you make the bottom section of this pane taller by dragging the central &apos;grab&apos; bar vertically upwards

      <taskGroup kind="sequence" name="Defining your workspace" skip="false">
         <intro>
            In comparison with prior versions of Debrief, Debrief NG introduces the concept of a Workspace - a central repository for your assorted analysis-related documents.  Within this workspace your work is grouped into individual projects: thus you can quickly switch between concurrent analysis tasks.  Debrief&apos;s provision of projects allows you to quickly drag and drop Debrief data-files and plots.
         </intro>
         <onCompletion>
            Right, Debrief now knows where to find your data.  In the next series of steps you will load and examine some data.

               If you already have one or more folders containing Debrief data, 
               you can add them to your Debrief NG project (or load sample data that was installed within Debrief NG).  
               If you've haven't got any sample data, or if you can already see the <b>Sample Data</b> folder in your

               Debrief can plot information from library datasets to add context to the current view.  
               Because of their typical size, these datasets are not distributed with Debrief, but should be obtained separately.
