         <b>Introduction</b><br/>
This collection of cheat sheets will teach you how to use Debrief&apos;s Semi Automated Track Construction (SATC) capabilities.
         <br/><br/><b>Tip:</b>  If you have multiple monitors, you may wish to drag out this <b>Cheat Sheets</b> window to give
         you more room for the multiple Debrief windows that you will use later on.

Before we get started with loading and manipulating data, we&apos;re going to learn some of the background terms and concepts.

            <b>Conclusion</b><br/>
            Ok, that's the boring school work out of the way. The rest of this cheat-sheet is all conducted here in Debrief.

            <b>Introduction</b>
Let&apos;s start off with an easy scenario. We&apos;re going to work on an engagement where there is just a single leg of target data.
         </intro>
         <onCompletion>
            And that&apos;s the end of the tutorial for single-leg target track construction.

            <intro>
               To be able to save your tutorial data, you need a Debrief <b>Workspace</b> to store your data in.
               But, if you have a Debrief <b>Navigator</b> window open, and in it you can see one or more folders in it, you can skip this step.
            </intro>
            <onCompletion>
               <b>Conclusion</b><br/>
You now have a Debrief <b>Project</b>, to contain your tutorial data.

            <intro>
               There are two ways to load the sample data. We&apos;re probably going to end up modifying the sample data,
               so you shouldn&apos;t
               do that if you&apos;re working on a set of sample data that's shared with other users  (since you
               would be modifying the <b>master</b> copy of the data). Start off by considering if your Debrief installation folder
               is on your local machine, or on a Network Shared Folder.

               <intro>
                  You should have a Debrief project open. You will also need a link to the Debrief <b>sample data</b>.
                  So, open up the projects in your <b>Navigator</b> window, and see if there is a folder titled <b>Sample Data</b>,
                  that contains a folder called <b>SATC</b>. If there is one there, you can skip this step.

               <b>That&apos;s it for single leg solutions.</b>  Now close the Debrief plot containing the single-leg solution,
