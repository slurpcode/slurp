   <intro>
      <description>
         You have now provided background data to SATC, now you can ask it to generate a solution.

         title="Calculate the solution">
      <description>
         It&apos;s quite easy really, just click on <b>Calculate Solution</b>.
         Within a second or so you will see a new track appear on the plot (though you may need to zoom out a little).
         <br/>The track will be the same color as you specified for the bearing data in the Bearing Import Wizard.
         <br/>By default, SATC is in <b>Low</b> precision. This instructs SATC to use fairly relaxed constraints, and come up
         with an answer within a few seconds.  In this scenario we have quite sparse bearing data, and the ownship
         manoeuvres mean that there aren&apos;t very many candidate solutions.
         <br/>At the time of writing (April 2014), a solution of 9.0kts on 269 degrees is returned.  If you wish, you can try using a high precision.
         I don&apos;t think you will get a better solution, but you will notice that the <b>Performance</b> graph (at the bottom of
         the (<b>Maintain Contributions</b> view) growing more slowly as SATC homes
         in on a particular solution.  You will see that the x-axis (on the bottom) shows more cycles have been
         run through, and that each one moves more slowly.

      <description>
         The data we&apos;re using here is from a simulation tool.  That means we also have the target track.
         So, try dragging in <b>L1_SubjectTrack.rep</b>
         and comparing the SATC solution with the truth track.
         <br/>You will see that SATC is quite close to the truth, with a greater error to the
         West, near the start. This is because of the low bearing
         rate near the start - both tracks appear to be on a roughly parallel course.
