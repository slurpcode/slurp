         This cheat sheet covers the process for merging two or more tracks.  These tracks may be conventional platform tracks produced from positional sensor data, or they may be TMA tracks produced from the analysis of bearing data.<br/>
Please see the associated help page for a discussion of the track merge operation.

         In this tutorial you have generated two track sections and you now wish to combine them into one track.  In the Outline View, select the two tracks <b>TMA_xxxx</b> and <b>TMA_yyyy</b> (use the [control] key to multi-select).

         Next, right click on one of the selected tracks and select <b>Group tracks into TMA_xxxx</b>.  You&apos;ll see the second track disappear, and inside the <b>TMA_xxxx</b> track you&apos;ll see two track segments,

         Debrief is now able to provide a track section between the two existing track segments.  To do this, open the <b>Track:TMA_xxxx</b> track, and then the <b>Track segments (2 items)</b> item.  Inside you&apos;ll see the two new segments.  Select both of them, and right-click on one of them - you&apos;ll be able to select <b>Generate infill segment</b>.  You&apos;ll see a new segment appear both in the Outline View and the plot.  Notice that the infill segment is shown as a dotted line - to indicate that this track segment is not based on any evidence, it&apos;s just been calculated to join the tracks either side.

         You can continue to keep your target track represented as 3 or more track segments for as long as you like.  But, when you need to export the data for presentation or subsequent analysis then you need to merge them.  To do this, select the parent item for the track segments (<b>Track segments (3 items)</b>), right-click on it and select <b>Merge all track segments</b>.  The tracks will merge.  Note, alternatively you could have selected different track segments to merge by selecting them individually at the next level down.

            label="Note: If the track sections cover overlapping time periods the merge operation will fail. Just decide which track is the more accurate track and trim the time period of the other track, then start the merge operation again. If track overlap is a frequently occurring problem, please contact the maintainer and a merge algorithm will be developed."
