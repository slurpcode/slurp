      <description>Debrief NG stores it&apos;s data in a local folder called a Project. It&apos;s into this
         folder that you place analysis files and links to existing data folders elsewhere on your
         machine/network. This tutorial will lead you through creating a new, blank project.

   <item title="Check Navigator is open">
      <description>In the top left hand corner of Debrief you should find the Navigator window. If
         it isn't there, select "Navigator" from Debrief's Window/Show View menu.</description>
   </item>
   <item skip="true" title="Learn about the Show View menu">
      <description> Was the navigator view already open? If it was then you&apos;ve missed out on
         the Show View menu. Just open the Window menu from the top of Debrief, and select <b>Show
            view</b>. A list of Debrief-specific views will open. So, in the future, if you&apos;re
         directed to a view but you can&apos;t find it, just remember you can open any view from
         this menu, </description>
   </item>
   <item title="Learn about the Quick Access panel">
      <description> Alternatively, wherever you are in Debrief, you can popup the quick access
         panel. Just hold down the <b>[ctrl]</b> key, press <b>3</b> and a yellow post-it like menu
         will appear. As you start typing &apos;Navigator&apos; the list of available commands will
         shrink down until your required view is open. Obviously, this is of greater relevance to
         those who favour keyboard over mouse. </description>

   <item title="Learn about Views in Debrief">
      <description> As you&apos;ll have read, the Navigator panel is an example of a View in
         Debrief. Views are supplemental panels that provide additional information (or control) to
         the conventional 2D Debrief plot. They can be closed by clicking on the <b>X</b> icon on
         their name tab. They can also be dragged around, both within Debrief (to put them, for
         example on the opposite side of the application), or out of Debrief into a separate window.
         When you close Debrief, it remembers the views that were previously open. </description>
   </item>
   <item title="Check you need a project">
      <description>If the navigator window is empty, then you need to create a project. If the
         window already contains a folder-icon (possibly containing sample data) then hey, you're
         ready to go, well done! Return to the Welcome page and select another tutorial (such as
         'Getting your data into Debrief'. Otherwise, tick the 'Complete' box below and continue
         with this tutorial.</description>
   </item>
   <item title="Create a 'General' project" dialog="true">
      <description>Right-click in the Navigator view, and select <b>Project...</b> from the
            <b>New</b> sub-menu. The New Project wizard will open. From the <b>General</b> folder,
         select <b>Project</b>, and then press <b>Next</b>. Now just enter a name for your project
         (this could be the name of the current exercise). If you&apos;re in a workplace where users
         are unable to create folders in their home directory, clear the <b>Use default location</b>
         checkbox, and <b>Browse</b> to a folder in your personal working directories. (Note: you can ignore 'Working Sets' for now).
         Then just press the &apos;Finish&apos; button, and you will see the new project in your workspace.
