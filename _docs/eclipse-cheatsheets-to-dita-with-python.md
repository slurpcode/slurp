# Overview

The motivation for this project comes from my mate Phil, who loves his
Python...he even was talking up Java over Ruby - a programmer's best friend -
and I forgot to mention to Phil something that is even better than Java and Ruby
combined is JRuby.

This projects originates from a Java based Project, where I built an
[Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org) based publishing pipeline inside
[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org).

This project will hopefully transform
[Eclipse cheat sheets](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/enterprise-architecture/eclipse-cheat-sheets.html)
to DITA with [Python](https://www.python.org).
