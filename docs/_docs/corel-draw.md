CorelDraw is a Windows environment application for graphic design which uses vectors to represent 
shapes instead of bitmaps. It was created in 1989 and has been evolving through 21 versions to this day. 
The current version is CorelDraw 2019, and it includes a bitmap editing application, Corel Photopaint, a 
very complete program to work with photos or any other bitmap image, as well as some other apps. 
Corel 2019 was released, for the very first time, for Apple MacOS as well as for Windows.
Vectors: digital images can be stored as grids of colored points (pixels) known as bitmaps, so even the 
best quality picture, when you expand it or take a very close look, will show these colored pixels and 
smooth lines will become saw lines that look like stairs. Vectors do not use bitmaps, but mathematical 
functions to represent shapes. A function can work with very small numbers or very big numbers all the 
same and will always be precise, so you can look at a vector image from a distance or very close and it 
will always look perfect, no pixels, smooth lines all the time, and has the advantage of requiring far less 
memory to be stored than bitmaps.

Another good point for vectors is that images can be translated into bitmaps with as much quality as 
needed, while the inverse conversion is far less efficient and will produce worse results.
CorelDraw has become a very professional tool for the graphic designer, including a huge variety of 
working alternatives like basic shape drawing  (lines, squares, circles and ovals, polygons, stars, spirals, 
grids, curves), shape editing (weld, trim, intersect shapes), text tool, text into curves conversion, node 
editing, interactive fills (flat color fill, gradient fill, pattern fill, bitmap fill), translucent shadows and 
glows, translucent shapes, and basic bitmap editing.  CorelDraw has the capability to manage bitmaps 
together with text and  vectors to produce complex compositions like magazine pages, so it's a great 
alternative for publishing composition, multi-page files, bitmap tracing, effects like perspective or shape 
distorting, and dozens of other tools.

The user interface of CorelDraw is very intuitive and friendly, and digitizing tablets can be used with the 
program, allowing the designers to produce artistic and lively images.
To help users, there is a wide support net which includes blogs, videos, tutorials and chat communities.
