# Quick Start Install

The Ruby script **`run.rb`** builds various files in this repository when run,
including `README.md`, `site.yml`, `robots.txt`, `log.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and all the websites HTML5 pages.

Which means you should **never** edit these files as they are all automatically generated by the Ruby script.

This automatic file creation functionality is also controlled by the repositories main config file `config.yml`.

## macOS

For all three language requirements Ruby, Python and Perl most people recommend not using
 the system installed versions of those languages.

For managing Ruby versions I recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) with [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) which can be easily installed
with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  You can see if Ruby is installed on your system by
typing in a terminal: `ruby -v`

After installing Ruby 2.5 you can run `bundle install` from the
repositories root directory to install the needed RubyGems.

[Python 3.6](http://brewformulas.org/Python3) can also be installed with Homebrew.  After installing Python
you can open a terminal and type: `python3 --version`

You can also install [Perl 5 through Homebrew](http://brewformulas.org/Perl) and you can see
if Perl is already installed by typing in the terminal: `perl -v`

[Cloc](http://brewformulas.org/Cloc) is the only package that needs Perl.

The lowest version of Perl that I have tested with is Perl 5.18.2 but I have also tested with the
current maintenance release Perl 5.26.1.  The [Perl releases](https://www.cpan.org/src/) can be seen at CPAN.

## Windows

This project has not been tested on Windows based Operating Systems.

To help out and get started on Windows I recommend you install [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/) or try using
[ActivePerl](https://www.activestate.com/activeperl) and also install Ruby 2.5 with the [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/).

You should use the [Get-FileHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-6)
 PowerShell utility to check the integrity of both Strawberry Perl and the RubyInstaller.

## Linux

Again, no testing so far on Linux based Operating Systems.

On Linux you could use possibly [RVM](https://rvm.io/) to manage your Ruby versions.

## Ideas about the project

Seems these days that JavaScript has become so popular and even this project is using a huge amount
of JavaScript mostly in the form of JavaScript libraries.

So I suppose the natural progression for this project would be to introduce [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as well as
add more types of charts.  [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/15-best-javascript-charting-libraries/) has a good showcase on the 15 best
JavaScript charting libraries.

Another idea is to use more shell commands to access other programming languages or charting libraries.

Another concept is the addition of other styles of chart like horizontal and vertical bar charts.
