The Avenue of Stars is like being on the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, but of course, this street pays homage to the great Chinese artists, you can see the footprints of Jackie Chan or take a photo next to the statue by Bruce Lee.

## Kowloon Park

It is likely that at some point during your visit to this city you prefer something to relax and the best place to unwind than Kowloon Park, where you can walk through this great lung of Hong Kong and watch the old people practice tai chi or perhaps have a bath to cool off in its public pool. As a curiosity we tell you that until 1987 the old neighborhood of Kowloon was in this area, at that time it was one of the most dangerous places on the planet, where not even the police dared to enter, but today it is the opposite and far from worrying about passing through this area, you will be filled with a lot of tranquility.

## Hong Kong Beaches

If you want to go to the beach, of course there are several to visit since you are on an island, the most recommended are Stanley Beach or South Bay, however, we do not believe that it is one of the essential activities to do in Hong Kong.

## Eat at Tim Ho Wan

This city has a very interesting food scene and trying some of its dishes like the pork and prawn dumplings or maybe its bbq pork stuffed buns at a restaurant called Tim Ho Wan is one of the best things you can do in this city town. To give you an idea, this is one of the cheapest restaurants in the world and it has a Michelin star, a generous dinner for two costs less than €20, and its food is truly spectacular.

## Hong Kong temples

If you are a lover of Chinese temples, you cannot miss the Wong Tai Sin Temple, which is definitely one of the most important in Hong Kong.

## Monster Building

## Longest escalator in the world

The longest escalator on the planet is located in Hong Kong, it measures approximately 800 meters, it is located between the Mid Levels and Central. Although it is true that it is not a single staircase, since it is rather a stretch of different stairs, it is still worth traveling this route that lasts about 20 minutes.

## Double-decker trams

One of the most original ways to visit Hong Kong is on one of its 2-story trams. The recommendation is to go upstairs, specifically in the first row to get the best views.

## Macau Island Tour

You can take an excursion to visit the island of Macao or as many call it "the casino island". It is a very strange and curious place since it is a mixture between Portugal, China and Las Vegas, this strange place seems to us to be a very interesting place to visit.
Hong Kong is an island with many tourist activities to do and impressive sites that are worth visiting.
