## Bangkok markets

Haggling in the markets is one of the best things to do in Bangkok. There are markets at night, during the day, on top of the train tracks, on the water, clothing, food, flowers, among others and the most famous are:

## Chatuchak Market

Chatuchak has more than 8,000 stalls and is one of the largest markets in the world. It is best to arrive first thing in the morning as the large number of people who come daily can overwhelm you later. You can get to this market by taking the metro and going down the Chatuchak station.

### – Damnoen Saduak Floating Market

Although it is true that this market is almost two hours by bus from Bangkok, this is the most touristic and famous market in the city, because it is traveled in a traditional boat, from where you can buy souvenirs, fruits, spices and handicrafts, either in the shops on the shore or in other street vendor boats.

### – Maeklong Market

This market is one of the most impressive on the planet because it is located on the tracks of a working train and when the horn sounds, in a few minutes the market is dismantled and reassembled after the train passes.

### – Patpong Night Market

It is located in the red zone of Silom, being one of the busiest and most famous markets in Bangkok, but you must be careful because most of its products are fakes, so you will have to pay little and haggle a lot. In addition to the market you will be able to see strip shows and clubs, so if you travel with children you should take this into account.

Other markets that are less touristy but that are also recommended to visit are the flower market on Chak Phet Road, the Sampeng Market in Chinatown, the Or Tor Kor food market, the Amphawa floating market, the amulets market that It is close to the Royal Palace and the Pratunam clothing market.

Due to its popularity, many massage parlors, shops, restaurants and hotels are now located near Rambutri Road, so the shopping area has expanded somewhat beyond Khao San Road.

## Chao Phraya

The Chao Phraya River divides the city in two and also has a series of secondary channels that are known as klongs. You can rent a boat ride through the canals where you can see the floating houses on the shore and the way of life of its inhabitants. To travel along this river you have several options, since in addition to the small motor boats, you can use the public boat that stops at the different docks or also the ferry that crosses the river. You can even book a dinner cruise to see the illuminated temples and the city from a more romantic perspective.
