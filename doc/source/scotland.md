# 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland

Scotland is part of the 4 countries that make up the United Kingdom.
Together with Wales and England it forms part of the great island of
Great Britain and consists of more than 790 islands. Scotland, more than
monuments and cities, is a country that impresses with its landscapes,
its lakes and dreamy castles.

The recommendation to get to know Scotland is to rent a car either in
Glasgow or Edinburgh, to have the freedom to stop wherever and whenever
you want, in front of a beautiful waterfall, a castle or on the shore of
a lake, this is simply priceless.
