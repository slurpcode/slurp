Termen’s Harmonium was an early vacuum tube based polyphonic instrument designed to accompany vocal performances.
The instrument had a three octave keyboard with a variable tuning that allowed 1,200 micro-tonal divisions per octave. The timbre and volume of the sound could be varied using twelve dials fixed to the front of the instrument.
