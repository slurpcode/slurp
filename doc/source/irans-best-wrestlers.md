# 🤼 Iran's Best Wrestlers

Iran has provided some of the best talent that the world has seen throughout the many years of Iranian wrestling dominance.

That tradition has been long-standing, and today we showcase the top five Iranian wrestlers. Coming in, the youngest star for Iran who's enjoying the prime of his career Hassan Yazdani.

You don't earn the nickname The Greatest without earning it and Yazdani has certainly did his part to carry on the tradition of Iranian wrestling.

The 25-year-old won the 2016 Rio Olympic gold medal at 74 kilos and has captured a pair of world championships to go along with a bronze and silver medal as well. The Greatest knows a thing or two about the power of social media with nearly 500,000 followers on Instagram making him a national star and certainly the greatest in Iran.

Rasoul Khadem enters our list too, one of the most monumental moments in Iranian wrestling history took place in the 1996 Olympic games when Khadem stunned two-time Olympic gold medalist and five-time world champion Makharbek Khadartsev to capture his lone Olympic gold in his storied career.

After a near miss following a bronze medal performance in the 92 Olympic games Khadem's Olympic title run will be a story long told in Iranian culture. Khadem went on to win a pair of world titles along with five asian championships.

A blast from the past checks in, with Abdulla Movahed, a five-time world champion raised eyebrows in his senior level debut back in 1959 and his career took off from there.

Movahed was a two-time Olympic champion bringing the prestigious gold back to Baboslar in both the 64 and 68 games.

Movahed was perfect during a five year stretch in the prime of his career, not losing a match while claiming five world titles.

Iran's first ever Greco-Roman Olympic champion comes in. Hamid Sourian was part of an unparalleled powerhouse 2012 Iranian squad. Sourian was one of three Greco-Roman champions for Iran in the London games and also represented Iran in both the 2008 and 2016 Olympic games.

The six time world champion won 34 consecutive matches before disqualification and a bad streak in the 2015 world quarter finals. And the strong tradition of Iranian wrestling can be found back in 1951 that's when Gholamreza Takhti made his senior level debut.

Takhti comes in at number one. Nicknamed the World Champion, Takhti was a three-time Olympic medalist capturing gold at the 56 Olympic games. He also earned a pair of silver medals in both the Helsinki and Rome Olympic games. The two-time world champion was inducted into the United World Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2007.

The native of Tehran passed away at the all too young age of 37, but his legacy and the impact he had on Iranian wrestling will last forever.
