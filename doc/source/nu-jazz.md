# 🎼 Nu Jazz

Nu Jazz is Acid Jazz without the Acid.

Nu Jazz is one of the youngest electronic music trends. In terms of its origins, the acid jazz of the early nineties, some easy listening,
house, trip hop and of course jazz such as Sun Ra (with his intergalactic band) was the starting point. James Blood Ulmer's concept
of new harmology, projecting the shadow of change, the new wind direction. Eclecticism, eclecticism, eclecticism .. Everything can
go with everything, endless fusions, John Coltrane with world music, funky Brazilian motifs, 1975 jazz-rock with broken beats, and
more. Perhaps we can’t talk about any style, just aspirations that fall into the nu jazz collector category. Their only common feature is
that one way or another, but jazz is always present. Actual jazz musicians, of course, see this quite differently, they associate it with
something completely different when they hear the “nu jazz” expression. This time Berlin is the place of birth and not the UK. It all
started sometime in the second half of the nineties, in Jazzanova’s studio. House, downtempo, saxophones, Latin melodies, pleasant
spins, champagne pops, beyond the rumble, the murmur: the boys had already composed post-millennium music before the
millennium. The members of the renowned collective are: Jürgen von Knoblauch, Alexander Barck, Class Brieler (they are the record
readers), Alex Reinemar, Stefan Leisering, Rosko Kretschmann (and they are the producers).

The best known label is Compost - including Les Gammas, the more abstract Kyoto Jazz Massive, Syrup and the Trüby Trio, among
others. But still the Jazzanova, or the Voom Voom (Peter Kruder and Fauna Flash) also help.
The spirit of Vienna haunted...
Some selections include late pieces from Future Sound of Jazz, as well as Glücklich’s opuses.
Another prominent figure in the trend is the Italian Nicola Conte. His home pioneers are the Keyser-Shuriken duo.

There are other sonic markers that jazz scholars (yes, those exist) like to indicate as instrumental in the development of Nu Jazz
including the works of Jon Hassel, Bugge Wesseltoft, and Miles Davis, because it always comes back to Miles Davis. But mostly it
was 90s electronic-fusion that got the ball rolling. And because it sounded so different from the staunch traditional stuff of yore it
could only be regarded as something new, or Nu. But not Gnu.

Labels who had supported Acid Jazz and other forms of Downtempo had no problem getting up on that Nu Jazz business (Wall Of
Sound, Ninja Tune, Qaungo, Acid Jazz).
