# 🎹 Optophonic Piano

The Optophonic Piano was a one-off electronic optical instrument created by the Russian Futurist painter
Vladimir Baranoff Rossiné (Born in 1888 at Kherson , Ukraine – Russia, died Paris, France 1944). Rossiné
started working on his instrument c1916. The Optophonic Piano was used at exhibitions of his own paintings and
revolutionary artistic events in the new Soviet Union, Rossiné later gave two concerts with his instrument
(with his wife Pauline Boukour), at the Meyerhold and Bolchoi theatres in 1924. Rossiné was influenced by the
ideas of Alexander Scriabin who connected sound and colour with music to produce a aesthetic synthesis – this
current formed an important, almost mystical theme within Russian electronic music; through the photo-audio
experiments of the 1930’s until the ANS Synthesiser (itself named after Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin- ANS)
in the 1940s.

"The Optophonic Piano projected revolving patterns onto a wall
or ceiling by directing a bright light through a series of revolving painted glass disks, filters, mirrors and lenses."

" The keyboard controlled the combination of the various filters and disks. The variations in opacity of the painted disk and filters were picked up by a photo-electric cell controlling the pitch of a single oscillator. The instrument produced a continuous varying tone which--accompanied by the rotating kaleidascopic projections--was used by Vladimir Rossiné at exhibitions and public events."

“Imagine that every key of an organ’s keyboard immobilises in a specific position, or moves a determined element, more or less rapidly, in a group of transparent filters which a beam of white light pierces, and this will give you an idea of the instrument Baranoff-Rossiné invented."
