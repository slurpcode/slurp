# 🎹 Electro

"It's one of the most mysterious, controversial genre in electronic music. It's been around for a very long time, and it's been reborn 
several times. Insiders are convinced that it's really coming up now. But, with some exaggeration, we could say that it doesn't exist: 
there are hardly any "clearly" electro music producers, and publishers aren’t crowded either. ”

The interesting thing about the genre is that it clearly merges with other musical worlds, be it hip hop, breakbeat, or even drum and 
bass (John B - 1998). Robotics (instrumentation, vocal) appears in almost all its elements. It is based on well-defined, simple rhythm 
formulas with an analog world of sound, sometimes accompanied by recorded sound samples (such as metal tools).

"Electro (or electro-funk) is a genre of electronic music and early hip hop directly influenced by the use of the Roland TR-808 drum 
machines, and funk. Records in the genre typically feature drum machines and heavy electronic sounds, usually without vocals, 
although if vocals are present they are delivered in a deadpan manner, often through electronic distortion such as vocoding and 
talkboxing. This is the main distinction between electro and previously prominent genres such as disco, in which the electronic sound
was only part of the instrumentation. It also palpably deviates from its predecessor boogie for being less vocal-oriented and more 
focused on electronic beats produced by drum machines."

"The roots are to be found in Germany's seventies, in Kraftwerk's studio in Düsseldorf. Then came the golden age between 1982 and 
1985. This is New York, the years of post-disco vacuum. The trend was called electro-funk: the second part of the combination of 
words is clearly a reference to the North American black music tradition. Electro Phunk was also the title of Shock 82's hit album. 
The big hit was a joint by Herbie Hancock and Bill Laswell, Rock It. "

"The early 1980s were electro's mainstream peak. By the mid 1980s, the genre moved away from its electronic and funk influences, 
using harder edged beats and rock samples, exemplified by Run DMC. Electro became popular again in the late 1990s with artists 
such as Anthony Rother and DJs such as Dave Clarke. A third wave of popularity occurred in 2007. Electro has branched out into 
subgenres, including electrocore and skweee."
