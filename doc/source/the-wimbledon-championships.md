# 🎾 The Wimbledon Championships

The Wimbledon Championship is the oldest and most prestigious tennis event in the world, it takes place between the months of June and July, being the third tournament of the four Grand Slam tournaments. The first is the Australian Open which is played on a cement court, the second is the Roland Garros whose court is clay or brick dust, while the Wimbledon is on grass or grass and the last of these is the Open of United States where the players once again compete on the cement court.

At Wimbledon all the players wear white going back to their roots and it is the only one of the Grand Slam tournaments that is played on grass. Wimbledon was traditionally held in late June and early July for two weeks, beginning on the last Monday in June and ending with the men's and women's singles finals, which were scheduled for Saturday and Sunday of the second week. But in the year 2015 there were changes in the tennis calendar and the event was moved by a week, starting in early July. Although it is true that the tournament lasts two weeks, it can be extended in case of rain. Both men's and women's singles tournaments, men's and women's doubles tournaments, as well as doubles are played simultaneously. But the individual and double youth tournaments are also played, for women and men. There are even special invitational tournaments for retired players, which are men's doubles for players over 35 and 45 and women's doubles for players over 35. In 2021 the champions in the individual category were Ashleigh Barty and Novak Djokovic.

The first Wimbledon tournament was organized by the "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club" and was held in 1877 where only the men's singles category was played, the women's singles entered in 1884 and it was not until 1913 that it was implemented the doubles category.

The tournament rapidly gained international relevance, especially when the American May Sutton won the singles championship in 1905 and was the first foreign woman to do so, while the first foreign victory for the men's singles was won by the Australian Norman Brookes in 1907.

In 1922 the championship venue was moved to a track near Church Road and remains Wimbledon today. German forces bombarded the complex with five bombs during World War II in October 1940, one of the bombs destroying the equipment room, while another fell on the roof of the Central Court.

While it is true that the British take great pride in the tournament, for a long time it was part of the national mourning and humor, since 1936 when Fred Perry won the men's singles championship, no Briton won it again until Andy Murray She achieved this feat again in 2013. It should be noted that since 1977 when Virginia Wade won this award, no other British woman has managed to win this championship again.

## The biggest finals in Wimbledon history

The greatest tennis matches have been held on this stage, among which the match between Björn Borg and John McEnroe on July 6, 1980 stands out. All the spectators thought that the match was a masterpiece, John McEnroe He came out with great force from the first moment passing over the Swede winning the first set with a 6-1 advantage, but from one moment to another Borg began to come back and cut the way on the scoreboard, winning the next two sets. Many thought that everything was already decided, without knowing what would happen in the fourth set, today what happened is still remembered as one of the best games ever seen on a tennis court. Both players reached the tiebreak and in that tiebreaker the spectators were delighted with the following 34 points, 22 minutes of history of the most exciting for this sport.

McEnroe saved five match points and managed to take the match to the fifth set while the fans vibrated at each point and despite the missed opportunity Borg was not intimidated and continued to control the North American's thrusts, his concentration reached such a point that he only lost three points with his serve for this set.
Both defending their games until reaching 7-6 and it was then that Borg managed to break McEnroe's serve by means of a crossover passing, which was recorded for history. Borg dropped to his knees on the grass, clenched his fists and raised them in victory.

## Wimbledom final in 2001

Another match to be remembered was the 2001 final between Goran Ivanisevic and Patrick Rafter. Croatian Ivanisevic was recorded in the record books as the only player who, being a special guest of the organization, won the Wimbledon championship.

Ivanisevic was ranked No. 125 in the FedEx ATP Rankings and due to rain, the final with Rafter was postponed until Monday. It was when 10,000 fans crowded for tickets the night before that the day began to be called "the Monday of the people".

The Croatian had been in virtual darkness for a year and a half, going 10-11 on the year due to a shoulder injury, so expectations weren't good and he was expected to advance just in case, a couple of rounds. However, from the start he dispatched five rivals to reach the final, three of them (Roddick, Rusedski and Henman) being grass specialists. Ivanisevic faced Patrick Rafter, double champion of the United States Open and finalist of the previous year.

That Monday the Croatian won 2 sets to one, but had to receive medical attention for his left shoulder injury.
In the fourth set it was thought that his temperament was going to play against him when they were 4-4, at the break point against the Croatian he hit an ace, but at that moment he was called a foot fault, in the second serve the ball was called bad and then the Croatian kicked the net, threw the racket and had an off-key argument with the chair umpire, later Rafter secured the fourth set. However, Ivanisevic was able to keep his cool and in the fifth set, the Croatian broke Rafter's resistance in the fifteenth game and that's when he got the chance of a lifetime from him, making the most of it.

In an emotional three-hour final, the Croatian won the match with the following score 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 2-6, 9-7, Ivanisevic's feat remains as one of the best in all the story, to the point that it inspired the making of a movie.

Rarely in life has a game been seen with so much nerve and so much emotion. Ivanisevic is the lowest-ranked tennis player in history to win Wimbledon and the only one to arrive as a special guest, as if that were not enough, the feat was performed in his 48th Grand Slam appearance and he is still the tennis player who it has taken longer to win his first “major” trophy.

The most moving moments were when the Croatian sat on the court with his eyes to the sky, screaming and shedding a few tears before winning the match. On his fourth championship ball, Ivanisevic fell to the grass and cried after winning his first Grand Slam title.

## Federer and Nadal in the 2008 final

Continuing with the best matches we cannot forget the 2008 Wimbledon Championship. The men's singles final was played between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who at that time were the number 1 and 2 players in the world respectively. After a heated confrontation of 4 hours and 48 minutes, Rafael Nadal defeated Federer with the score 6–4, 6–4, 6–7, 6–7, 9-7.

The two players had a rivalry that many believed was the greatest in tennis history. By the time they reached the championship in 2008, both players had managed to win 14 of the last 16 Grand Slam titles. At that time it was the third year in a row where Federer and Nadal met in the Wimbledon final, and Federer had also been the Wimbledon champion for the fifth time in a row and therefore had beaten Nadal in the previous two matches, this time trying to become the tournament champion for the sixth consecutive year.

For his part, Nadal had just been the Roland Garros champion for the fourth time in a row and was trying to achieve the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double, for connoisseurs of the sport, it is known that this feat is extremely difficult, because it requires that the player went from winning on a clay surface to a grass one, in just the span of a month.

Although it is true that the players had to be on the field at two in the afternoon, the game was delayed 35 minutes due to rain. Once the match started Rafael Nadal won the first two sets with a score of 6–4, 6–4, it was when the rain again stopped the game while Federer was winning the third set 5-4. After an 80-minute break as the weather settled, Federer managed to win the next two sets, both by scores of 7-6, thus saving 2 championship points for the fourth set of the tiebreak. It should be noted that this tiebreaker is considered by many to be one of the greatest in tennis history.

Federer later put the score in his favor at 5-2 and Nadal was able to win the title on his next two serves, but he committed two faults, as well as a backhand miss at the net, thus giving Federer the game back with the score. 4-5 against, but with his service. The score was positioned 7-7 when Nadal managed a passing shot and stayed in the match, Federer for his part responded with another passing shot to stay in the match. Federer subsequently won the tiebreak 10-8 sparking off a fifth set and then at 19:53, play was again rained out for another 30 minutes.

When they returned to the field it was already getting dark and they discussed delaying the match for the following day, but it did not happen. During the deciding set Federer was up 7-6, however Nadal held his serve and at some point he broke Federer's serve and in the next game, he had the serve in his hands winning the fifth set 9-7 and of course, the match. John McEnroe expressed on July 5, 2008 "It's the best game in history."

The match ended at 9:15 p.m. and it was the last Wimbledon final to be affected by rain, since the 2009 Wimbledon championships, the Central Court already had a retractable roof.

## 2009 Championship Final

The 2009 Wimbledon final was an event that everyone wanted to witness. Roger Federer and Pete Sampras were tied at 14 for the number of Grand Slams won in the Open Era, so much so that Pete Sampras flew all the way to London to watch the tournament.

The final was between Roger Federer and Andy Roddick, the first duel between the two occurred at Wimbledon 2004 and in this final, Roddick was chasing his first Wimbledon trophy.

The match was not what everyone expected with a devastating Federer, Roddick won the first set and the Swiss the next two in the tiebreak. The fourth set was won again by Roddick. The game lasted four hours and 16 minutes in which the American played the best tennis of his career, which was what allowed him to reach an epic fifth set, in which Federer required nothing less than 30 games to win the tournament. Federer had to suffer through these five sets against a punishing Roddick in an exciting match to proclaim himself Wimbledon champion for the sixth time. The Swiss managed to make history to become the first player capable of winning 15 Grand Slam titles, surpassing the mark that he had shared with Pete Sampras until then. The result was 5-7, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5), 3-6 and 16-14, adding his 20th final of a "big" and beating the American Iván Lendl to beat another mark and snatching Rafael Nadal the number 1 in the world.

## Djokovic vs Federer in the 2019 final

In the first set, Djokovic's colossal defenses, heroic points and Federer's entire repertoire were already present, which led to a well-deserved tiebreak. While it is true that the Swiss began this tiebreak with greater strength, then he had a small downturn and ended up delivering the first set. Then Federer in the second set got two breaks out and leveled the competition with a resounding 6-1.

Djokovic returned renewed in the third game and had to give the best of his service to save a ball when the score was 5-4 against. Once they got to another tiebreak there wasn't much difference between the level of one player and another. Djokovic, however, took the lead again by winning the third set. The Swiss reacted and scored two consecutive breaks which led to the fifth and final set, at that time the final was an ode to tennis.

In the fourth game of the fifth set Djokovic managed to have three breaks, the first two being with Federer's second serve and in the Swiss's next service it was when the Serb would give a blow to get the score in his favor 4- two. However, Federer's response was not long in coming, placing the score 6-6, at that time they had already passed the four hours of battle and Federer broke the Serb's serve, but inexplicably wasted two balls with his serve and the match was revived contest. The unexpected 12-12 came and the final went down in history for becoming the first Wimbledon match to feature this tiebreaker. It was then that Novak Djokovic once again crowned Wimbledon in one of the finals that has been considered one of the most legendary in tennis history, where both players displayed all their magic.

Numerous records in tennis history were broken in this match:

• The longest game with 11 hours and 5 minutes

• The longest set, the fifth set lasted 8 hours and 11 minutes

• The most games in a set, with a total of 138 in the fifth set.

• Highest number of aces made by a single player in a match, Isner hit 113 aces and Mahut had the second most aces hit by a player in a single match.

• Most aces made in a single match (216)

• Highest number of points won in a single match, this record was held by Mahut with 502 points.

• Greater number of points (980) obtained in a single game.

As we stated before, the time played was 11 hours and five minutes, breaking the record, but what we want to highlight is the abysmal difference that exists with respect to the previous record, which was in the match between Fabrice Santoro and Arnaud Clément at Roland Garros of the year 2004, where they played for 6 hours and 33 minutes.

Regarding the games played in a match, they broke the record with 183, the previous records were established by Andy Roddinck who required 83 games to beat Younes El Aynaoui at the 2003 Australian Open and Pancho Gonzales who needed 112 games to defeat Charlie Pasarell in 1969, but this was all before the tiebreak was introduced in 1969.

The 8 hours and 11 minutes that the fifth set lasted is longer than the previous record for the longest complete tennis match in history.

The record for the number of aces was set by Isner with 113, but the previous record was held by Croatian Ivo Karlovic with 78 aces in the 2009 Davis Cup. Even the number of total aces (216) far exceeded the previous record Karlovic and Štěpánek had it with 96 aces in total, in the 2009 Davis Cup.

Even Queen Elizabeth II was present at the final points of the match, in fact, it was the first time in more than three decades that she had attended a Wimbledon match.
